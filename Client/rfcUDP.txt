1. Introduction

    This UDP Protocol is one of the 2 Protocols done for the R-Type
    project (third year Epitech's project). It specify the events of
    the client-server communications inside a lobby and in a in-game
    lobby.

    Once the lobby is created in a thread, the client-server
    communications are done by using this R-Type UDP Protocol. Firstly
    in the lobby, secondly when the game is started.

    All the client-server communications in lobby and when then game is
    starting are done by using this UDP Protocol.

2. Header

    2a. Format Header

        Header is compose of :
            SOURCE_PORT : (transmitter)
            DESTINATION_PORT : (receiver)
            BODY_SIZE : (number)
            BODY : (data)

    2b. General data transmission

        The BODY in the header is composed of binary data that contains
        various structures for both UDP and TCP Protocol.

        In UDP Protocol, the structures sent are generally data about
        a position of a sprite and where does the client need to print
        it in the game window. They are sent regularly to give the
        impression of fluidity.

        Example : 0x0 (continuer l'exemple ensuite)
        (.....)

3. Lobby

    When a client enter a lobby, he receives informations about the
    others clients and the parameters of the game. The lobby can host
    4 clients at maximum on the same lobby.

    3a. Lobby data transmission

        The server send informations about others clients with the
        following instructions :

            1st argument (number) : position in lobby (1st to 4th)

            2nd argument (number) : size of player's name

            3rd argument (string) : name of player

            4th argument (enum) : color of ship of this player

        Moreover, the server send the parameters of the lobby on
        entering the lobby and everytime they change.

    3b. Lobby player Events

        The player can execute few events in the lobby, principally
        optional informations that may help clients to recognize each
        others. These events are describred below :

            CHANGE_NAME,
            CHANGE_COLOR,
            READY

        The CHANGE_NAME event :

            The player can change his name in the lobby that refresh the
            informations for other players.

        The CHANGE_COLOR event :

            The player can change his ship's color in the lobby that
            refresh the informations for other players. players can't
            have the same color.

        The READY event :

            The player can change a boolean to notify the others players
            that he is ready for the game or that he isn't anymore.

4. Game started

    When the game start, the server send to the client many (not all)
    sprites that he has to display for the user.

    4a. Game data transmission

        The server send a list of struct (SPRITE_LIST) containing the
        sprites (SPRITE) that the clients needs to display.

        The SPRITE message contains :

            1st number : id of an entity
            
            2nd and 3rd number = X and Y coordinate respectively
                            (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                            corner in its SPRITESHEET

            4th number = the sprite's width (in pixels)

            5th number = the sprite's height (in pixels)

            6th and 7th number = X and Y coordinate respectively
                            (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                            corner in the GAME_WINDOW

        A number of sprites is not handled by the server (Background)

    4b. Game server Events

        In addition to the Game data transmission of the sprites, the
        server can do additional events described below :

            PING_CLIENT,
            SEND_WAVE_BOSS,
            DISCONNECTED_CLIENT

        The PING_CLIENT event :

            The server send a ping to the client to avoid inactivity,
            the client must respond and if not, the player is considered
            to have left the lobby (see QUIT_LOBBY event on 4c).
        
        The SEND_WAVE_BOSS event :

            The server send to the client the current wave number or
            if a boss is approaching with the following informations :

                WAVE : number
                BOSS : name of the boss

        The DISCONNECTED_CLIENT event :

            The server send to all the client connected which player
            has left the lobby.

    4c. Game client Events

        The client can execute several events to play the game. With
        every event, the client send a message to the server to notify
        the server. All the events available for the client are
        described below :

            MOVE,
            SHOOT,
            QUIT,
            (Optional or for after prototype :
                LEVEL_UP,
                REPAIR,
                ...)

        The MOVE event :

            The client can move it's own player ship (up, down, left
            right). He can use 2 of the following who aren't opposite:

                UP,
                DOWN,
                LEFT,
                RIGHT

        The SHOOT event :

            The client can shoot to eliminate his enemies with a variety
            of shoots available below:

                NORMAL_SHOOT,
                CHARGED_SHOOT,
                (ULTIMATE_SHOOT ?)
                (Optional shoots with bonuses)

        The QUIT event :

            The player quit the lobby or the party, send QUIT event
            with additional informations described below :

                QUIT_LOBBY,
                QUIT_GAME

        (Others events : ...)

5. Error Handling

    In UDP Protcol, the fluidity of the data sent back and forth can
    leads to package's loss and that's when the error handling interfere
    to guarantee protection for crashes.
