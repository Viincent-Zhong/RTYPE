1. Introduction

   This TCP Protocol is one of the 2 Protocols done for the R-Type
   project (third year Epitech's project). It specify the events of
   the client-server communications inside the game menu.

   When the player connect to the game, he is connected to the TCP server for
   create his account,
   create a game,
   get all available games and
   join a game.

   All the client-server communications in the menu are done by using
   this TCP Protocol and when joing a Menu, the client is redircet to
   the UDP server.

2. Format Header

   Header is compose of :
      SOURCE_PORT : (transmitter)
      DESTINATION_PORT : (receiver)
      HEADER_AND_BODY_SIZE : (number)

3. Format Body

   Body is compose of :
      STATUS_CPDE : (enum)
      Data : (class)

4. Menu

   When a client enter the menu, he receives informations about the games available.
   The server can host an undifined number of client.

   4a. Menu data transmission

      The server send no informations when connecting to it :

   4b. Menu Client Events

      The Client can execute few events in the Menu :

         CREATE_GAME,
         JOIN_GAME,
         GET_GAMES,
         CREATE_CLIENT

      The server repsons:

         DATA_GAME,
         BAD_PARAMETERS,
         CLIENT_NOT_CREATED,
         CAN_JOIN_GAME,

         BAD_NAME

      The CREATE_GAME event :

         The Client can create it own game,
         see Network/NetworkUtils/TCPData/DataStructur.hpp to see the data you need.
         For to be able to create a game, the Client need to be create.
         Response:   DATA_GAME: server send data about the UDP server for join the game
                     BAD_PARAMETERS: bad parameters
                     NO_PARAMETERS: missing parameters
                     CLIENT_NOT_CREATED: Client not created

         For to be able to join a game, the Client need to be create.
         Response:   CAN_JOIN_GAME: server send data about the UDP server for join the game
