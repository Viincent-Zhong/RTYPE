1. Introduction

   This TCP Protocol is one of the 2 Protocols done for the R-Type
   project (third year Epitech's project). It specify the events of
   the client-server communications inside the game menu and in the lobby.

   When the player connect to the game, he is connected to the TCP server for
   create his account,
   create a game,
   get all available games,
   join a game,
   got to lobby and
   start game

   All the client-server communications in the menu are done by using
   this TCP Protocol and when starting a game, the client is redirect to
   the UDP server.

2. Format Header

   Header is compose of :
      CODE: unsigned int
      MESSAGE_SIZE: unsigned int

3. Format Body

   Body is compose of :
      STATUS_CODE : (enum)
      Data : (class)

4. Menu

   When a client enter the menu, he receives no data from the server.
   The server can host an undifined number of client.
